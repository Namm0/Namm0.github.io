### 题目
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

* If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array** `chars`. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

##### Example 1 :
```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

##### Example 2 :
```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

### 思路
一開始我就覺得是雙指針解法，左右指針指向String中的char判斷是否相同，`右-左`來確定個數。沒有考慮到用String來表示數字，而是很笨的`int/10`要判斷到千位數。參考了別人的答案之後，有兩個重點：
* 右指針自己判斷個數，左指針負責寫。
* String/StringBuilder charAt()可以更方便寫數字

### Code
```java
    class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int i = 0;
        int len = chars.length;
        int j = 0;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        if(len == 1) return 1;
        while(i < len){
            int count = 1;
            char c = chars[i];
            while(i < len - 1 && chars[i] == chars[i+1]){
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            chars[j++] = c;
            if(count > 1){
                sb.append(count);
                while(sb.length() > 0){
                    //自己維護一個StringBuilder可以節省空間
                    //用完就delete，只要取0位上的char就可以
                    chars[j++] = sb.charAt(0);
                    sb.deleteCharAt(0);
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```
